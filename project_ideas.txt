[Idea 1]

1. Why are you interested in this topic?
My first idea is to write a 2D football game where the primary action involves heading the ball. The game's objective is to score points by heading the ball into the opponent's net. It features both a single player and an AI opponent for added challenge.

Players will need to input their ID, and the game will keep a record of the top five highest scores in a database. I am interested in this project because it combines my passion for both programming and football. 


2. How hard do you think it will be, and why?
My research suggests that this project will be somewhat difficult. Making a 2D game with player-AI interaction and database integration is more complex, even though I understand Python at a basic level and some basic programming concepts from CS5001. It can be difficult to develop collision detection, player controls, and game mechanics. Furthermore, I will need to gain more knowledge about database operations in order to work with databases to store and manage high scores. 


3. Besides the core CS5001 content, what else will you need to learn to complete the project?
- Game development with Python
- Collision detection: Learning how to detect collisions between game objects
- Artificial intelligence
- Database integration


4.What are the biggest pros and cons?
Pros: learn new concepts about game development with Python, graphics and databases
Cons: It will be a time-consuming project


5. How will you get started?
I will explore online resources, tutorials, and documentation related to game development with Python, collision detection techniques, AI programming, and database integration.
Furthermore, I will start by creating a basic game framework and gradually implement features, such as player movement, AI behavior, and scoring logic.


[Idea 2]

1. Why are you interested in this topic?
The Pomodoro timer project idea appeals to me because it blends programming and productivity strategies. It's a useful application of my Python skills, and it can help users manage their time more effectively.

2. How hard do you think it will be, and why?
This project should be moderately challenging, in my opinion. Despite my foundation in Python from CS5001, I will need to put in more time and effort to learn how to send notification when time is up, and integrate with database to track users records.

3. Besides the core CS5001 content, what else will you need to learn to complete the project?
In order to finish the project, I'll need to gain knowledge of databases management, and send notifications.

4.What are the biggest pros and cons?
Pros: It's a very practical tool if I made it. Also, I will learn databases and more libraries in Python.
Cons: less time-consuming project(compared to idea 1)


5. How will you get started?
I'll start by looking into Python libraries and how to interact with database. After that, I'll begin coding the timer, testing and improving the program as I go.
